# RentalCar 
This is my first project built using a framework. I developed it during my training while applying to the Binusian IT Division. The project is a Rental Car website designed for renting cars, featuring a simple user interface and user experience. Since this was my first time working on such a project, there may be a few bugs and some design issues.
